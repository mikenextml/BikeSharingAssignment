## General Information

This project aims to analyze the demand for a bike-sharing service using regression analysis on various factors.

The core objective of the project is to identify key variables impacting the demand and thus, enable BoomBikes to anticipate demand and optimize resource allocation.

The dataset used for this project is provided by UpGrad. The dataset filename is 'day.csv', which contains daily data on bike rentals alongside associated environmental and seasonal variables.

## Conclusions
Weather conditions significantly impact bike rentals. As conditions worsen, the demand for bike rentals decreases.
Based ont the data, the progression of seasons from spring to winter positively affects bike rentals, with demand peaking in winter.
